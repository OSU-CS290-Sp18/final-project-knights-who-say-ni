Requirements:

* The app uses client-side JS to enable relevant user interactions with the client interface.
* The app is served using a Node.js-based (or other approved) serving stack.
* The app dynamically generates pages based on data stored in a back end data store, such as MongoDB.
* The app’s client interface communicates with the app’s server to create, read, update, and/or delete content in the back end data store.
